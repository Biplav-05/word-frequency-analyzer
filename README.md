python
Copy
Edit
from utils import remove_punctuation

# Sample text
text = "Hello, world! Let's test: regex."
cleaned_text = remove_punctuation(text)

print(cleaned_text)
# Output: "Hello world Lets test regex"
Function: word_frequency
This function counts the frequency of each word in the cleaned text.

python
Copy
Edit
from utils import word_frequency

# Sample text
text = "Hello, world! Python is great. Python, Python!"
cleaned_text = remove_punctuation(text)
frequency = word_frequency(cleaned_text)

print(frequency)
# Output: {'hello': 1, 'world': 1, 'python': 3, 'is': 1, 'great': 1}
📊 Time Complexity
remove_punctuation: O(n), where n is the length of the input text.

word_frequency: O(n), where n is the length of the cleaned text.
